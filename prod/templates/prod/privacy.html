        shopping experience.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-center"><b>What information do TNG TECH SOLUTIONS need to collect from you as a
            customer?</b></p><br>
    <p class="mt-3 text-center">TNG, in dealing with you as a customer, may need to collect and retain information that
        identifies you as a customer so that transactions can be carried out either online or personally. The
        information we may collect includes:
        For establishing an account:<br>
        ● Name and address(es)<br>
        ● Contact telephone number(s) and email address(es)<br>
        For personal identification:<br>
        ● Photo ID – either NZ Driver’s license, passport (NZ or foreign), or an NZ 18+ card (Note foreign driver’s
        licenses cannot be verified and are therefore not accepted)<br></p>

    <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-center"><b>Why do TNG TECH SOLUTIONS collect and retain personal information?</b></p><br>
    <p class="mt-3 text-center">We use this information to undertake any dealings or transactions with you (see the
        {link of terms and conditions page of TNG e-commerce website} for further details). Personal photo ID
        information may not be needed unless you need to personally pick up goods from any one of the TNG stores, and we
        need to ascertain that the person picking up the goods is the correct person as per the transaction. We may take
        a copy of the identification supplied. This is also to protect your interest and security as a TNG customer.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-center"><b>Who can access this information and whom is it shared with?</b></p><br>
    <p class="mt-3 text-center">The information will be collected by specified TNG employees who need to have access to
        your data to carry out the transactions. The level of accessibility to your data is proportional to the job
        function that each team member performs.
        We may disclose aggregated shopper statistics, but none of these statistics will contain any information about
        identifiable customers and their shopping habits.
        Certain information may be made accessible to other persons or bodies corporate engaged by TNG for or concerning
        any of the purposes listed in the use of information <a href="{% url 'tandc' %}">of terms and conditions page of

    <p class="mt-3 text-center">If you do not wish to provide the information asked for, you have the right to refuse to
        provide it, however, TNG may not be able to proceed with the transaction if the information required is
        necessary for TNG to ensure the transaction is conducted legitimately while protecting the interests of both TNG
        and you as the customer.<br></p>

    <p class="mt-4 mb-2 text-center"><b>Storage of personal information</b></p><br>
    <p class="mt-3 text-center">We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of your
        personal information. We have taken many steps - from both technical and systems perspectives - to ensure that
        all of your information is well protected, however, we also recommend that you do not disclose your login ID and
        password to anyone.<br></p>
