        do not limit or alter your rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act (other than in the circumstances permitted
        under that Act). You can find more information about your rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act at the
        Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment's website

        we notify you of such change. If you exceed your credit limit, we can refuse to supply goods to you.
        If we at any time consider your creditworthiness to be unsatisfactory we can require security for payment.

        consent.<br></p>

        for despatch at our premises.

        provided.
        If you supply goods and if a claim is made directly against us by a consumer under the Consumer Guarantees Act
        then you will refund to us the amount of any damages (up to the value of the margin you made on the goods in
        question) we are required to pay to that consumer under the Consumer Guarantees Act.
        Nothing in these terms is intended to have the effect of contracting out of the provisions of the Consumer
        Guarantees Act except to the extent permitted by the Act.
        Except as otherwise required or prevented by-laws including the Consumer Guarantees Act, or except as expressly
        provided under these terms, we are not liable for any claim in relation to any goods we supply to you (including

        costs and disbursements) in recovering payment of any overdue account.

        that the due date has not arisen.
        Without limiting any other rights or remedies, upon termination we will be entitled to repossess and resell any
        unpaid goods in accordance with the term of terms risk and ownership. Termination shall not relieve you from any
